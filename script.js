                <h2>About the Prize</h2>
                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The Mabati Cornell Kiswahili Prize for African Literature was founded by Mukoma Wa Ngugi and Lizzy Attree in 2014 to promote writing in African languages and encourage translation from, between and into African languages. The Prize sets a historical precedent for African philanthropy by Africans and shows that African philanthropy can and should be at the center of African cultural production.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Over 140 million people speak Kiswahili in Eastern and Southern Africa. Kiswahili is also one of the official languages in Kenya and Tanzania. Through some of the most prolific African writers and poets writing in Kiswahili, such as Shaban Roberts and Ebrahim Hussein there is a large body of work in Kiswahili that has long been a staple language in leading research universities e.g. Nairobi University, Boston University and University of Wisconsin – Madison. In other words, Kiswahili is an established world language and should be considered as such.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Moving from the principle that all languages are created equal and no one language should thrive at the expense of the other, we are proposing that a Kiswahili Prize for Literature be established with the express goal of promoting reading and writing in African languages. Literary prizes highlight fresh talent, encourage authors and demonstrate that reading matters.</p>
                    <p>While there exists international literary prizes for African writing such as the Caine Prize and the recently established, Etisalat Prize, there are no major international and Pan-African literary prizes awarded to works produced in an African language. The Jomo Kenyatta Prize for Literature is a biannual award organized by the Kenya Publishers Association to recognize outstanding works published in Kenya in English and Kiswahili.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>These facts alone make an international Kiswahili literary prize historical in nature, setting a precedent for other literature in African languages while making an important contribution to the body of world literature.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>We are grateful for your support and patience as we embark on this language adventure.</p>

Mutembei, Dr. Salma Omar</strong> and <strong>Dr. Joseph Nyehita Maitaria</strong>. He also announced that <strong>Prof. Rocha Chimerah </strong>and<strong> Dr. Hamisi Babusa </strong>will judge The Nyabola Prize, a special 2021 award for youth writing science fiction and speculative fiction in Kiswahili, for writers aged between 18 and 35.</p>
                        <p>“The Mabati-Cornell Kiswahili Prize for African Literature has seen an unprecedent increase in the number of entries, from 96 in 2019 to 256 in 2021. This year, the entries also came from 13 countries across the world, including Tanzania, Kenya, &nbsp;Uganda, Burundi, Uganda, Egypt, Nigeria, and the African diaspora in the USA, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Finland and the Netherlands. “It is very encouraging to see that the Prize is not only truly pan-African, but also extends beyond the continental borders,” said Munyao Kilolo, the Prize Administrator.</p>
                        <p>The Chair of the Board of Trustees, Abdilatif Abdalla, said, “It makes my heart dance with joy to see how increasingly responsive the participants are and the higher quality of entries submitted as the Prize gets more widely known and becomes more inclusive. It is my earnest hope that this competition will ultimately assist in realizing the Pan-African dream which we have been yearning for all these years. I also would like to urge &nbsp;female writers to participate more in order to bridge the gender gap which currently exists.”</p>
                        <p>Ms. Nanjala Nyabola, founder of the Nyabola Prize, a special award for 2021 for youth writing science fiction and speculative fiction in Kiswahili, said “Its very important for Kiswahili language communities to remain involved in the development and use of new concepts in technology,” said Nyabola, “and what better way to do that than to support exciting and captivating storytelling around science and technology”.</p>
                        <p>The judges will work together to select a shortlist that will be announced in November 2021. The winning entries in each category will be announced at an awards ceremony in mid- December in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.</p>
                        <p>After suspending the 2020 edition due to the challenges wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Prize founders, Dr. Lizzy Attree and Prof. Mukoma Wa Ngugi, are excited to see this re-energized participation.The growth of the Prize, from strength to strength, is an excellent example that is encouraging other prizes in African languages.</p>
                        <p>Founded in 2014 by Dr. Lizzy Attree and Prof. Mukoma Wa Ngugi (Cornell University), the Prize has the express goal of recognizing writing in African languages and encouraging translation from, between and into African languages.</p>

</p>

<p>The Safal Kiswahili Prize for African Literature was founded in 2014 by Dr. Lizzy Attree and Dr. Mukoma Wa Ngugi to recognize writing in African languages and encourage translation from, between, and into African languages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    The 2022 judges; Prof F.E.M.K. Senkoro (chair, Professor Emeritus), Dr. Magdaline Nakhumicha Wafula (Moi University, Kenya), and Dr. Hamisi Babusa (Kenyatta University, Kenya) selected the following and they both received prize money of US $5,000 Dollars each. <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Dotto Rangimoto </strong>was born in Morogoro, Tanzania, in 1986. He won the Safal Kiswahili Prize in 2017, and his winning manuscript, <em>Mwanangu Rudi Nyumbani,</em> was subsequently published by Mkuki na Nyota Publishers, Dar es Salaam. Dotto completed his secondary education in 2004 at Morogoro Secondary School. Thereafter he has been involved in small enterprise business and farming. He is a great enthusiast of Kiswahili Literature, especially novels and poetry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><strong>Salum Makamba</strong> is a young writer from Tanzania. In addition to novels, he writes short stories, poems, fiction, essays and articles on various social issues. Salum trained as a medical doctor from the University of Dar es Salaam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his speech, the Prime Minister His Excellency Kassim Majaliwa congratulated the winners and praised the management of the Prize, its board, and the sponsors, led by Safal Group, for their important work in promoting literature in African languages, particularly Kiswahili.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CEO of Safal Group, Mr. Andrew Lindgren, also spoke at the ceremony and highlighted the importance of the Kiswahili language in the development of the East African region. “Through our support of these awards, The Safal Group is firmly committed to the course of African languages. I commend ALAF Limited and MRM for organizing the award ceremony each year.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On behalf of the panel of judges, Prof Senkoro (chair) commended the 2022 entrants for the high quality of their writing, saying that it made it very difficult for the judges to pick out the first-place winners. “This is sufficient evidence that we have a great treasure of creativity, especially among young people, that transcends the boundaries of each country, and which if sprinkled with the basics of writing and publishing literary works will greatly strengthen Kiswahili literature,” added Prof Senkoro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr. Walter Bgoya of the Mkuki and Nyota Publishers, the official publisher of the winning manuscripts, said, “The Safal Award has raised talented writers in the field of literature since it was established in 2014, and there is no doubt that it has given writers inspiration and made the award ceremonies a day of great joy in the lives of those who are lucky enough to win.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He also emphasized on awakening the spirit of scholars in Tanzania and elsewhere to start promoting the Kiswahili language in science and technology. “There are scholars who are already focused on doing that. What they need is for their work to be recognized and used,” he added.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second-place winner in the Fiction category was<strong> Isaac Ndolo </strong>(Kenya) for his manuscript<strong> <em>Wimbo wa Hatima</em></strong> (<strong>The Final Song</strong>), and in the Poetry category was<strong> Ally Bakari Mchanyato </strong>(Tanzania) for his manuscript<strong> Uswahilini. </strong>Each received 2,500 USD.</p>

She loves Swahili language and literature. When she was still a student of African languages and literatures more than twenty years ago, she started to help to organizing the annual Bayreuth Swahili Colloquium and she still runs it every year. Her research has mostly focused on old, pre-colonial Swahili poetry which has been preserved in Arabic script. In recent years, she has concentrated on some of these manuscripts which have travelled widely all along the East African Coast and can be found in Kenya, Tanzania as well as Mozambique. Together with colleagues from Francophone and comparative literature, she has a research project on the networks of literature and arts, linking various countries and parts of the Indian Ocean. Clarissa Vierke is principal investigator of the Cluster of excellence “Africa Multiple. Reconfiguring African Studies” and the spokesperson of the research section Arts and Aesthetics. Together with colleagues from Leipzig and Cologne in Germany, Stellenbosch (South Africa), Wukari (Nigeria) and Eldoret (Kenya), she set up the project “Recalibrating Afrikanistik” funded by the Volkswagen foundation with the aim to plan the future of the study of African languages and literatures.</p>
